Here’s a complete `README.md` for your **GenJARVIS: Voice-Controlled AI Desktop Assistant** project that integrates local LLaMA inference, voice recognition, and GUI:

# 🤖 GenJARVIS — Offline AI Desktop Assistant

GenJARVIS is a fully offline, voice-activated AI desktop assistant with a modern Tkinter GUI, optional LLaMA local language model support, and interactive features like voice commands, media control, app launching, and Wikipedia/web search.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🎤 Voice input via `speech_recognition`
- 📣 Text-to-speech with `pyttsx3`
- 🧠 Local LLaMA model inference via `llama-cpp-python` (optional)
- 🌐 Web + Wikipedia search
- 📅 Time, jokes, and media playback
- 🧰 GUI built with `tkinter` and `ttk` (custom theming)
- 📦 Offline friendly — no internet required (if LLaMA model is used)

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 wikipedia speechrecognition llama-cpp-python
````

**Optional:**

* LLaMA Model (`.gguf`) — place in `models/` directory.
* FFmpeg or PortAudio might be required for microphone support.

> ✅ Works offline — no OpenAI API or cloud dependencies required.

---

## 🚀 Run the Assistant

```bash
python genjarvis_improved.py
```

You can type or speak commands like:

* `What is artificial intelligence?`
* `Open Chrome`
* `Play music`
* `Tell me a joke`
* `Search machine learning`
* `What's the time?`

---

## 🤖 Using LLaMA with `llama-cpp-python`

1. Download a `.gguf` model (e.g. [LLaMA 2 7B Chat Q4\_K\_M](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF))
2. Place it in `models/` directory.
3. The script automatically detects and loads it if available.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

* ❗ **Speech not recognized?**
  Install PortAudio and use a proper microphone.

* ❗ **No response?**
  Make sure `llama-cpp-python` and `.gguf` model are valid, or fallback to basic mode.

* ❗ **GUI crashes?**
  Ensure all imports (`tkinter`, `pyttsx3`, etc.) are installed and compatible with your Python version.
